(Ha-ha-ha-ha) / You shone like the sun /  / Shine on, you crazy diamond /  / Now there's a look in your eyes / Like black holes in the sky /  / Shine on, you crazy diamond /  / You were caught in the crossfire / Of childhood and stardom / Blown on the steel breeze / Come on, you target for faraway laughter / Come on, you stranger / You legend, you martyr, and shine /  / You reached for the secret too soon / You cried for the moon /  / Shine on, you crazy diamond /  / Threatened by shadows at night / And exposed in the light /  / Shine on, you crazy diamond /  / Well, you wore out your welcome / With random precision / Rode on the steel breeze / Come on, you raver, you seer of visions / Come on, you painter / You piper, you prisoner, and shine
